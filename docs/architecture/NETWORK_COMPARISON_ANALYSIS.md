##  **Key Differences**

### **1. Memory Architecture**
```python
# SimpleBrainNetwork
class SimpleBrainNetwork:
    def step(self, external_input):
        # Process input, update neurons, return spikes
        # NO MEMORY of what happened
        return spikes

# CognitiveBrainNetwork  
class CognitiveBrainNetwork:
    def step_with_cognition(self, external_input, context):
        # Process input, update neurons
        # STORE episodic memory with context
        # FIND associations with past memories
        # GENERATE inferences if requested
        return {spikes, memory_id, inferences, ...}
```

### **2. Learning Capabilities**
```python
# SimpleBrainNetwork: Basic Hebbian
def apply_learning(self, input_spikes, learning_rate):
    for input_id in self.weights:
        if input_id in input_spikes and input_spikes[input_id]:
            self.weights[input_id] += learning_rate  # Simple strengthening

# CognitiveBrainNetwork: Associative + Consolidation
def store_episodic_memory(self, pattern, context):
    # Store rich memory with context
    # Find associations with existing memories
    # Add to consolidation queue for strengthening
    return memory_id
```

### **3. Intelligence Level**
- **SBIN**: Reactive processing (input → spikes → output)
- **CBN**: Cognitive processing (input → memory → associations → inference → output)
