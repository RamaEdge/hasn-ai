## ️ Architecture Overview

### What Makes This Brain-Like?

1. ** Spiking Neurons**
   - Temporal dynamics (leaky integrate-and-fire)
   - Adaptive thresholds
   - Refractory periods
   - Real spike timing

2. ** Biological Learning** 
   - Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP)
   - No backpropagation - purely biological rules
   - Local learning at synapses
   - Homeostatic regulation

3. ** Cognitive Features (Built on Spiking Core)**
   - Working memory (7-item capacity like humans)
   - Attention mechanisms (selective focus)
   - Memory consolidation
   - Structural plasticity
   - Episodic memory, associations, and inference (see Cognitive Layer)

4. ** Modular Design**
   - Hierarchical organization
   - Specialized modules (sensory, memory, executive, motor)
   - Inter-module communication
   - Emergent behavior

##  Training Methods Implemented

### 1. Pattern-Based Training
- Define specific input patterns
- Repeated exposure builds recognition
- STDP strengthens relevant connections
- Example: Teaching word meanings, concepts

### 2. Sequence Training
- Temporal pattern learning (A → B → C)
- Context-dependent responses
- Memory formation across time
- Example: Language sequences, actions

### 3. Continuous Learning
- Real-time adaptation during use
- No separate training/inference phases
- Ongoing plasticity
- Example: Conversational learning

### 4. Interactive Learning
- Learn from user feedback
- Question-answering format
- Adaptive responses
- Example: Educational dialogue

### 5. Meta-Learning
- Learning how to learn
- Adaptation strategies
- Transfer between tasks
- Example: Rapid skill acquisition

##  Training Your Brain AI

### Basic Training Loop
```python
from core.simplified_brain_network import SimpleBrainNetwork

# Create network
network = SimpleBrainNetwork([30, 25, 20, 15])

# Define patterns
pattern = {0: {i: True for i in range(5)}}  # Activate neurons 0-4 in module 0

# Train
for epoch in range(20):
    result = network.step(pattern)
    print(f"Epoch {epoch}: Activity {result['total_activity']:.3f}")
```

### Interactive Training via API
Use `POST /training/interactive` with `context` to form episodic memories.

### Text-to-Pattern Training
```python
def text_to_pattern(text):
    pattern = {}
    # Length encoding
    pattern[0] = {i: True for i in range(len(text) // 3)}
    # Content encoding
    if '?' in text:
        pattern[1] = {i: True for i in range(5, 10)}
    return pattern

# Train on text
text = "Hello, how are you?"
pattern = text_to_pattern(text)
result = network.step(pattern)
```

##  Monitoring Learning Progress

### Key Metrics
- **Activity Level**: 0.5-2.0 (optimal range)
- **Memory Usage**: 5-7/7 (active utilization)
- **Attention Focus**: >2.0 (selective processing)
- **Weight Changes**: Monitor synaptic plasticity
- **Pattern Recognition**: Test on known patterns

### Success Indicators
 **Stable Activity**: Consistent neural firing  
 **Memory Formation**: Working memory utilization  
 **Attention Development**: Selective focus on relevant inputs  
 **Pattern Learning**: Recognition of trained sequences  
 **Adaptive Responses**: Context-appropriate outputs  

##  Advanced Usage

### Customize Network Architecture
```python
# Larger, specialized network
large_network = SimpleBrainNetwork([
    100,  # Sensory processing
    80,   # Memory/association
    60,   # Executive control
    40,   # Motor output
    20    # Meta-cognitive
])
```

### Adjust Learning Parameters
```python
# Modify plasticity
for module in network.modules.values():
    for neuron in module.neurons:
        neuron.learning_rate = 0.05  # Increase learning speed
        neuron.stdp_window = 25.0    # Longer temporal window
```

### Create Custom Training
```python
def custom_training_protocol(network, data):
    for pattern_name, pattern_data in data.items():
        # Multiple exposures
        for _ in range(10):
            result = network.step(pattern_data)
        
        # Test recognition
        test_result = network.step(pattern_data)
        print(f"{pattern_name}: {test_result['total_activity']:.3f}")
```
