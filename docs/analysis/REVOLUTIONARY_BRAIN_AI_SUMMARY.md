### Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)

```python
# Revolutionary learning rule based on spike timing
if pre_spike_time < post_spike_time:
    # Strengthen connection (LTP)
    weight += learning_rate * exp(-(post_time - pre_time)/tau)
else:
    # Weaken connection (LTD)  
    weight -= learning_rate * exp((post_time - pre_time)/tau)
```

### Working Memory Implementation

```python
# Brain-like working memory with capacity limits
class WorkingMemoryBuffer:
    capacity = 7  # Miller's magic number
    decay_rate = 0.01  # Temporal decay
    
    def update(self, current_time):
        # Remove old/weak memories naturally
        self.decay_memories(current_time)
```

### Attention Mechanism

```python
# Biologically-inspired attention
attention = softmax(
    0.6 * top_down_bias +     # Goal-directed
    0.4 * bottom_up_salience  # Stimulus-driven
)
```
