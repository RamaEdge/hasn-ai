# Brain-Inspired Neural Network Research

## Executive Summary
This document outlines research into creating a neural network that more closely replicates the human brain's structure and function. Based on current neuroscience understanding, we propose a novel "Hierarchical Adaptive Spiking Network" (HASN) architecture.

## Key Differences Between Current ANNs and Biological Neural Networks

### 1. Temporal Dynamics
- **Biological**: Neurons communicate through spikes over time with complex temporal patterns
- **Current ANNs**: Static activation functions with instantaneous processing
- **Our Innovation**: Implement temporal spike patterns with adaptive timing

### 2. Network Structure
- **Biological**: Highly irregular, small-world networks with modular organization
- **Current ANNs**: Regular layers with uniform connectivity
- **Our Innovation**: Dynamic topology with emergent modularity

### 3. Learning Mechanisms
- **Biological**: Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), homeostatic regulation
- **Current ANNs**: Backpropagation with fixed learning rates
- **Our Innovation**: Bio-inspired multi-scale plasticity rules

### 4. Energy Efficiency
- **Biological**: Extremely energy efficient (~20 watts for entire brain)
- **Current ANNs**: Power-hungry with continuous computation
- **Our Innovation**: Event-driven sparse computation

## Novel Architecture: Hierarchical Adaptive Spiking Network (HASN)

### Core Principles:

1. **Spiking Neurons with Adaptive Thresholds**
   - Leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with dynamic thresholds
   - Refractory periods and spike adaptation
   - Multiple timescales of adaptation

2. **Hierarchical Modular Structure**
   - Self-organizing modules (analogous to cortical columns)
   - Cross-modal integration areas
   - Dynamic routing between modules

3. **Temporal Pattern Learning**
   - STDP-based learning rules
   - Sequence memory and prediction
   - Rhythmic oscillations for binding

4. **Homeostatic Regulation**
   - Activity-dependent synaptic scaling
   - Intrinsic excitability regulation
   - Balanced excitation/inhibition

5. **Neurogenesis and Pruning**
   - Dynamic addition/removal of connections
   - Structural plasticity based on activity
   - Developmental-inspired growth patterns

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Spiking Infrastructure
- Implement efficient spiking neuron models

## Expected Advantages

1. **Energy Efficiency**: Event-driven computation reduces power consumption
2. **Temporal Processing**: Natural handling of sequential and temporal data
3. **Adaptability**: Self-organizing structure adapts to task demands
