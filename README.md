# 🧠 HASN-AI: Revolutionary Brain-Inspired Neural Network

**Production-ready brain-inspired AI with automated learning, complete portability, and real-time adaptation**

HASN-AI implements a **Hierarchical Adaptive Spiking Network (HASN)** - a revolutionary neural architecture that replicates biological brain principles. Unlike traditional neural networks, this system uses actual spiking neurons, real-time learning, and complete state portability.

## 🎯 **What Makes HASN-AI Revolutionary**

### **🧠 True Brain-Inspired Architecture**
- **Spiking Neural Networks**: Uses biological neuron models, not continuous activation
- **Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)**: Learns like biological brains
- **Hierarchical Modules**: Self-organizing cognitive architecture
- **Working Memory**: Integrated memory systems with natural capacity limits
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Selective information processing

### **💾 Complete Brain Portability** *(Revolutionary Feature)*
- **Save/Load Trained State**: Complete neural state preservation in JSON format
- **Cross-Platform Compatible**: Move trained brains between systems
- **Human-Readable Format**: Inspect and debug brain states
- **Perfect Restoration**: 100% identical neural patterns after loading
- **Version Control Friendly**: Track brain evolution over time

### **🌐 Automated Internet Training**
- **Continuous Learning**: 24/7 autonomous knowledge acquisition from web sources
- **Quality Filtering**: Intelligent content assessment and prioritization
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Updates knowledge as it learns
- **Memory Consolidation**: Simulates sleep cycles for memory strengthening
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time learning analytics and dashboards

### **🚀 Production-Ready APIs**
- **Multiple API Options**: Simple, advanced, and brain-native interfaces
- **FastAPI Framework**: Production-grade REST APIs with automatic documentation
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in security and performance controls
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive system health checks
- **Interactive Chat**: Real-time conversation with the brain network

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **1. Basic Demo**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run basic brain demo
python src/demos/simple_brain_demo.py
```

### **2. Start Production API**
```bash
# Launch production API server
python src/api/main.py

# Visit http://localhost:8000/docs for interactive API documentation
```

### **3. Run Cognitive Inference Examples**
```bash
# Scenario demos for the cognitive brain network (spiking-based cognition)
python examples/cognitive_inference_demo.py
```

The cognitive demos show:
- Episodic memory storage with context
- Automatic association discovery
- Inference generation through memory correlation
- Memory consolidation over time
- Temporal and analogical reasoning

### **4. Automated Training**
```bash
# Setup automated training
python setup_automated_training.py

# Start continuous learning
python src/training/train_cli.py start --profile production --continuous

# Monitor progress
python src/training/train_cli.py monitor
```

### **5. Train Cognitive Episodic Memory via API**
```bash
# Start API
python src/api/main.py

# Post samples with context to store episodic memories
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/training/interactive \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "input_data": [
      {"input": {"text": "Red is a color", "context": {"concept": "colors"}}},
      {"input": {"pattern": {"0": {"0": true}}, "context": {"concept": "greeting"}}, "label": "greeting"}
    ],
    "epochs": 1,
    "learning_rate": 0.01
  }'
```

The `context` ensures episodic memories are created and consolidated.

### **6. Brain Portability Demo**
```bash
# Demonstrate brain save/load capabilities
python demonstrate_brain_portability.py
```
