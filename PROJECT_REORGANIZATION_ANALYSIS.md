  - ✅ **KEEP**: Working demonstration of core concepts
  
- **`working_advanced_brain.py`** (311 lines) → `src/demos/`
  - ✅ **KEEP**: Simplified but functional cognitive demo
  
- **`demo_and_analysis.py`** (367 lines) → `src/demos/`
  - ✅ **KEEP**: Comprehensive analysis and comparison

#### 🎯 **TRAINING INTERFACES** (Consolidate - Overlapping functionality)
- **`brain_ai_interactive.py`** (682 lines) → `src/training/`
  - ✅ **KEEP**: Most comprehensive interactive interface
  
- **`comprehensive_trainer.py`** (503 lines) → `src/training/`
  - ⚠️ **REVIEW**: Overlaps with interactive trainer
  
- **`interactive_brain_trainer.py`** (515 lines) → `src/training/`
  - ⚠️ **REVIEW**: Similar to brain_ai_interactive.py
  
- **`quick_training_demo.py`** (241 lines) → `src/training/`
  - ✅ **KEEP**: Good for quick demonstrations

#### 🧪 **TEST FILES** (Consolidate - Too many small tests)
- **`pure_neural_test.py`** (195 lines) → `src/tests/`
  - ✅ **KEEP**: Good isolated testing
  
- **`simple_neural_test.py`** (78 lines) → `src/tests/`
  - ⚠️ **REVIEW**: Very small, could merge with others
  
- **`neural_response_demo.py`** (111 lines) → `src/tests/`
  - ⚠️ **REVIEW**: Could merge with pure_neural_test.py

#### ❌ **BROKEN/DEPRECATED** (Removed)
- **`advanced_brain_network.py`** (615 lines) → ~~Removed~~
  - ✅ **REMOVED**: Had structural issues, replaced by fixed version in `src/core/`

## 🎯 Duplication Analysis

### Major Duplications Found:
1. **Advanced Brain Networks**: 3 versions
   - `advanced_brain_network.py` (broken)
   - `fixed_advanced_brain.py` (working)
   - `working_advanced_brain.py` (simplified)
   - **Action**: Keep fixed + simplified versions

2. **Training Interfaces**: 4 similar files
   - `brain_ai_interactive.py` (most complete)
   - `interactive_brain_trainer.py` (similar functionality)
   - `comprehensive_trainer.py` (overlapping features)
   - `quick_training_demo.py` (simplified)
   - **Action**: Keep main + quick demo, review others

3. **Test Files**: 3 small test files
   - Could be consolidated into comprehensive test suite

## 🧹 Cleanup Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ **Reorganized** files into logical folders
2. ✅ **Created** package structure with `__init__.py`
3. ✅ **Removed** deprecated folder and broken files
4. ✅ **Renamed** fixed_advanced_brain.py to advanced_brain_network.py
5. ✅ **Added** comprehensive .gitignore file
6. ✅ **Cleaned up** temporary reorganization scripts

### Next Steps (Manual Review Required):
1. **Consolidate Training Files**:
   - Compare `brain_ai_interactive.py` vs `interactive_brain_trainer.py`
   - Determine if both are needed or merge functionality
   
2. **Consolidate Test Files**:
   - Merge small test files into comprehensive test suite
   - Create proper unit tests
   
3. **Update Import Paths**:
   - Fix relative imports in moved files
   - Update cross-references between modules

4. **Remove Duplicates**:
   - Delete original files from `/src/` after testing new structure
   - Clean up `__pycache__` directories

## 📊 Size Reduction Summary

**Before**: 13 Python files (4,835 total lines)
**After**: 12 Python files (4,220 active lines)
- Removed 1 broken file completely (615 lines)
- Organized into logical structure
- Added comprehensive .gitignore
- **Space saved**: ~615 lines of broken code permanently removed
- **Files cleaned**: deprecated folder, temporary scripts, cache files

## 🎯 Quality Assessment

### High Quality (Keep as-is):
- `brain_inspired_network.py` - Well-structured core
- `simple_brain_demo.py` - Good working example
- `brain_ai_interactive.py` - Comprehensive interface

### Medium Quality (Review/Consolidate):
- Training files have overlapping functionality
- Test files could be better organized
- Some demos could be simplified

### Low Quality (Deprecated):
- `advanced_brain_network.py` - Structural issues fixed in other version

## ✅ Verification Commands

Test the reorganized structure:
```bash
# Test core functionality
python src/core/brain_inspired_network.py
python src/core/advanced_brain_network.py

# Test demos
python src/demos/simple_brain_demo.py
python src/demos/working_advanced_brain.py

# Test training
python src/training/quick_training_demo.py

# Test validation
python src/tests/pure_neural_test.py
```
