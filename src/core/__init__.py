# Core Neural Network Architecture
"""
Core implementation of the brain-inspired neural network architecture:
- simplified_brain_network.py: Simplified Brain-Inspired Network (SBIN) - high-performance core implementation
- cognitive_brain_network.py: Cognitive Brain Network (CBN) - enhanced with inference and memory correlation

Performance test results show SBIN is 2.3x faster than alternative implementations
while maintaining all essential brain-inspired functionality.

CBN adds cognitive capabilities:
- Episodic memory storage with context
- Automatic association discovery between memories
- Inference generation through memory correlation
- Memory consolidation and strengthening over time
